Resume Screening and Ranking Using NLP & Machine Learning
Overview
This project automates resume screening by categorizing resumes into job roles and ranking them based on relevance to a job description. It leverages NLP techniques and machine learning models to enhance recruitment efficiency.

Key Features
âœ… Resume Classification: Categorizes resumes into job roles using models like BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT.
âœ… Relevance Ranking: Uses cosine similarity to compare resumes with job descriptions.
âœ… Fuzzy TOPSIS Ranking: Ranks resumes within each job role based on weighted criteria (CGPA, skills, degree, internship, gap years).
âœ… Text Extraction: Parses resumes from PDFs for structured analysis.

Workflow
Upload Resumes (PDF format)
Text Extraction & Preprocessing (Cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
Job Role Classification (Best-performing NLP model selected)
Relevance Scoring (Cosine similarity with job description)
Resume Ranking (Fuzzy TOPSIS method applied)
Final Output (Ranked resumes for selection)
